Six years would of been a much better estimation. That&#39;s 104x longer!  Looking back there were a few things that led to this project taking wayyyy longer than expected: <a href="#communication">communication</a>, <a href="#design">design</a>, and <a href="#supplies">supplies</a>.  I shed alot of tears and has some heated conversations with my dad thinking this project would never be completed.  For a few years, I couldn&#39;t even talk about the cabin unless we were actually working on it.  Looking back, I&#39;ve grown so much from this project and the complications. </p>
<h2 id="communication">communication</h2>
<p>We have a shed on the land and I originally thought about commandeering it and makeing it my cabin.  Realistally, that was not an option because we use it all the time for its practical sheddness duties.  We based our timeline on how long it took to build the shed, and added a little more time for the interior.  The cabin was going to be super simple! And then one purchase totally diverged the trajectory of the cabin.  </p>
<p>My father-in-law Mike sells doors and windows.  He invited me to come by the warehouse and look at the excess windows he had laying around.  Mostly it was stuff from discontinued suppliers or large one off windows.  Then he showed us a set of small of mahogany windows.  They were way to small for a normal home and had been sitting around for too long.  They were the perfect size for the cabin and he had enough to do the entire cabin.  Originally priced at $800/window; now $125/window.  I couldn&#39;t resist and left with six windows that day.  My dad couldn&#39;t stop talking about them and in his mind the cabin was totally changing.  It still had my original floor plan and foundation, but that was about it.  In his mind it moved from a simple structure to a miniature custom home.  </p>
<p>My dad&#39;s heart was in the right place.  He wanted us to make something beautiful and that would be used for years, but this became an issue because  he didn&#39;t tell me about his ideas until later.  I was blindly going along and didn&#39;t stop to question or challenge his ideas.  No longer could we talk concretely about timelines or finances.  It started to become his project and I was just standing by.   When I would ask about concrete things like timeline or costs it became very vague.<br>Working with family is really tricking and it&#39;s so easy to fall back into the role of child/parent.  My dad and I had never communicated on a professional level.  He would guide and I would follow.  I wasn&#39;t willing to own my ideas and push back.   If we we&#39;re going to finish this project things had to change.  Communication was a necessity!   I learned how to ask the right questions, insist on answers, and communicate my ideas.   He started to think of me as an adult. </p>
<p>Time: 
You can accomplish a ton with three weeks of solid work, but we didn&#39;t realistically have that.   I had school and work and he had a company to run, so for four years we could only sneak away for small chunks of time.  Working like this has so many challenges.  We were constantly having to figure out where we left off and what supplies we needed.  The closest hardware store was over thirty minutes aways, so if we forgot an essential tool we were screwed!  We started making lists of the tools we would need for the next workday.  </p>
<p>July 2014, my husband and I moved to DC for work.  The cabin wasn&#39;t dried in, so whenever it rained it was breading mildew and welcoming decay.    I figured the it would never be completed.  In November, I decided to make a career change. and before jumping into a new job I wanted to finish the cabin!!! My mom had recently retired and was willing to work with me and my dad was going to come out as much as possible.  I thought I could finish it   in two trips.</p>
<p>1st trip: ten days and finishing the <em>exterior</em>.  We finished the roof; caulked, puttied and painted the exterior; installed three windows and finished installing the porch.  It rained for three days, so we weren&#39;t able to get the entire exterior finished.  </p>
<p>My mom, dad, and brother amazingly spent the weekends in between working on the cabin.  They installed the rest of the windows and worked on the chimney.  </p>
<p>2nd trip: eight days and finishing the <em>interior</em>.  We insulated;  prepped, painted, and installed the panelling (walls and ceiling); put in the heart pine beams; installed two of the four french doors; and put up a temporary loft.  We thought is was going to be finished.  Things always take longer than planned!</p>
<p>I decided to push back applying for jobs and come back a few weeks later for a final trip to finish this phase of the cabin. </p>
<p>3rd trip: ten days and final touches.  We prepped and painted the interior, and furnished the cabin.  </p>
