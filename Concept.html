I wanted a place where my friends, family, or I could get away. I was a senior in high school and didn&#39;t know if I was going to stay in the area, but I wanted a spot I could always come back to. </p>
<p>I recruited my dad who is an custom home contractor. We started talking about what it would take to build a 12&#39;x16&#39; one room cabin with a loft.  I envisioned the space to be like a glorified tent: no plumbing, minimal electrical, and an outdoor kitchen.  Everything about it would draw you outside.  He graciously offered to let me use a large chunk of <a href="#reclaimedmaterials">reclaimed materials</a> he had saved up over the years. Over the next three years, I started saving money and gathering ideas, and he started squirreling away more reclaimed supplies.  We envisioned the project taking about three weeks of solid work and costing a few thousand bucks. </p>
<p>It didn&#39;t take three weeks and it&#39;s not a glorified tent.</p>
<h2 id="reclaimed-materials">Reclaimed materials</h2>
<p>The idea of using reclaimed materials really resonated with me: </p>
<ul>
<li>save $$$</li>
<li>fewer things going to the landfill (if you haven&#39;t been before GO, it is a sobering experience)</li>
<li>the aesthetic of old and used </li>
<li>cleaning out my parents&#39; exploding garage</li>
</ul>
<p>It also comes with challenges.  You need to have a <strong>source</strong>.  Thankfully my dad renovates homes and is always looking for useable materials.  Craigslist, Habitat stores, and local reclaimed material stores also are great places to find supplies.</p>
<p>We knew that we had to clean up the supplies to make them useable and this would take <strong>time</strong>, but this process consistently took WAY longer than expected.  For example, my mom and I spent an entire week cleaning up interior paneling.  We pulled thousands of rusty nails, cleaned, sanded, and primed boards. After it was prepped, the installation took more time and patience.  Most of the wood was warped or missing tongue and groove, and required brute force and creativity to get into place.</p>
<p>Using reclaimed materials also requires flexibility with <strong>design</strong> details.  We used three different materials for the siding: cedar shakes, wood siding, and hardie sheets.   The wood siding was reclaimed, but we only had enough to do 3/4th of the cabin.  We put cedar shakes on the front of the cabin and hardie plank on the chimney.</p>

<p>The tiny house movement was just catching wind, and people were sharing designs, challenges, and resources.  The idea of bigger is better was being challenged.  I loved this concept.
Here are a few sites that are brimming with ideas:</p>

<p>Before I started college, I spent a few months living in England and learned a ton from the different people who hosted me. I spent three days with a woman who had a refurbished shepherd&#39;s hut on three acres of woods.  She used it for a retreat for her and her friends.  She built an outdoor kitchen, cabana, and was planning to build an outhouse using humanure composting.  She talked about taking proper care of the woods and creating a healthy forest.  I fell in love with her space and mindset.  This was exactly the type of space I wanted to create.</p>
