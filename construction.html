<p>  Summer 2010: </p>
<p>  I finished my junior year at College of Charleston, and was psyched to have some dedicated time to work on the cabin. Morgan and I spent a few days clearing the land of young pine trees.  My dad, Morgan, and I put up stringers and layed out the foundation of the cabin.  We chose a <a href="http://www.civilengineeringx.com/foundations/pile-foundations/">pile foundation</a> for the cabin because of our location.  Pile foundations are very common in coastal regions because they allow water to pass underneath the structure without causing extensive damage. </p>

<p>  We didn&#39;t have any form of power at this point, so everything was laborious and sweaty. The Lowcountry becomes a steaming swamp in the summer! When we were digging the holes, we were constantly battling tree roots and clay. Half the time we were digging and half the time we were slinging an axe at impressively strong roots. </p>

<p>  A month after my brother&#39;s wedding, he and his wife joined us to mix concrete and put in the wood posts for the foundation.  Their company and help was great! We used 8&quot; x 8&quot; treated wood post for the cabin and back porch and 6&quot; x 6&quot; posts for the front porch.  We dug three foots holes for the posts and surrounded them with concrete.  The concrete was hand mixed with sand, rock, and pond water.  </p>
