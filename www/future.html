The interior of the cabin is finished, but there is so much more I want to do.  The outdoor kitchen, outhouse, and shower house aren&#39;t yet built.  We still rely upon a generator and propane for energy, and gallons water for drinking and hygiene.   If money was not an issue I would love to knock all of these things out.  We plan to save up over the next few years and work on these things we can.  </p>
