<p>Wolf Cabin was designed and built by me and my dad.  My family and friends have also been huge support through the entire project. My oldest brother Sam is a carpenter and is obsessed with the details! He would always ask to hold up the level one more time!  My mom is an eager worker; we call her The Ox.  She embraced any project we through her way whether it was priming hundreds of boards or holding a ladder.  My husband Morgan was my sanity through the entire project; he patiently listened to rants and worked whenever he had a chance.  The cabin wouldn&#39;t be here without family and friends!</p>

<p>I live in Washington, D.C. with my hubby and pups (Homer and Plato).  I decided to build the cabin when I was a senior in high school, and recruited my dad for his help.  It took me a few years to save up cash and get her ideas straight, but we broke ground in 2010.  Since the project started, we are constantly learning what to do and what not to do.  I am currently splitting my time between DC and SC to finalize the construction on the cabin.  Camping, crafting, and veggie cooking are what I do in my free time.</p>

<p>My dad, Joel, is a contractor who builds beautiful custom homes in the SC Lowcountry. When he&#39;s not on a job site, you&#39;ll probably find him covered in sand on the volleyball court or playing with his dogs.  He currently is building his retirement home near the cabin and plans to spend his later years living off-the-grid with my mom.</p>
