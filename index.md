##idea

In 2006, I started thinking about building a cabin.  I wanted a place where my friends, family, and I could go and be without the pressures of school, work, and expectations.  Every free weekend was already spent camping on family [land](#land) about an hour from our hometown, and this seemed like the perfect spot.  I was a senior in high school and didn't know if I was going to stay in the area, but I wanted a spot I could always come back to.  I recruited my dad who is an incredible contractor. 

We started talking about what it would take to build a 12'x16' one room cabin with a loft.  I envisioned the space to be like a glorified tent: no plumbing, minimal electrical, and an outdoor kitchen.  Everything about it draws you outside.  He graciously offered to let me use a large chunk of a [reclaimed materials](#reclaimedmaterials) he had saved up over the years. Over the next three years, I started saving money and gathering ideas, and he started squirreling away more reclaimed supplies.  We envisioned the project taking about three weeks of solid work and costing a few thousand bucks.

The idea of using reclaimed materials really resonated me for multiple reasons. 
  - save $$$
  - fewer things going to the landfill (if you haven't been before GO, it is a sobering experience)
  - the aesthetic of old and used 
  - cleaning out my parents exploding garage
  
It also comes with challenges.  You need to have a **source**.  Thankfully my dad renovates homes and is always looking for useable materials.  Craigslist, Habitat stores, and local reclaimed material stores also are a great places to find supplies.

We knew that we had to clean up the supplies to make it useable and this would take **time**, but this process consistantly took WAY longer than expected.  For example, my mom and I spent an entire week cleaning up interior paneling.  We pulled thousands of rusty nails, cleaned, sanded, and primed boards. After it was prepped, the installation took more time and patience.  Most of the wood was warped or missing tongue and groove, and required brute force and creativity to get into place.

Using reclaimed materials also requires flexibility with **design** details.  We used three different materials for the siding: cedar shakes, wood siding, and hardie sheets.   The wood siding was reclaimed, but we only had enough to do 3/4th of the cabin.  We decided to put cedar shakes on the front of the cabin and hardie plank on the chimney.

The tiny house movement was just catching wind, and people were sharing designs, challenges, and resources.  The idea of bigger is better was being challenged.  I loved this concept.

Before I started college, I spent a few months living in England and learned a ton from the different people who hosted me. I spent three days with a woman who had a refurbished shepherd's hut on three acres of woods.  She used it for a retreat for her and her friends.  She built an outdoor kitchen, cabana, and was planning to build an outhouse using humanure composting.  She talked about taking proper care of the woods and creating a healthy forest.  I fell in love with her space and mindset.  This was exactly the type of space I wanted to create.

Three weeks! That is the original amout of time we thought it would take to build the cabin.  Six years would of been a much better estimation. That's 104x longer!  Looking back there were a few things that led to this project taking wayyyy longer than expected: [communication](#communication), [design](#design), and [supplies](#supplies).  I shed alot of tears and has some heated conversations with my dad thinking this project would never be completed.  For a few years, I couldn't even talk about the cabin unless we were actually working on it.  Looking back, I've grown so much from this project and the complications. 

communication

We have a shed on the land and I originally thought about commandeering it and makeing it my cabin.  Realistally, that was not an option because we use it all the time for its practical sheddness duties.  We based our timeline on how long it took to build the shed, and added a little more time for the interior.  The cabin was going to be super simple! And then one purchase totally diverged the trajectory of the cabin.  

My father-in-law Mike sells doors and windows.  He invited me to come by the warehouse and look at the excess windows he had laying around.  Mostly it was stuff from discontinued suppliers or large one off windows.  Then he showed us a set of small of mahogany windows.  They were way to small for a normal home and had been sitting around for too long.  They were the perfect size for the cabin and he had enough to do the entire cabin.  Originally priced at $800/window; now $125/window.  I couldn't resist and left with six windows that day.  My dad couldn't stop talking about them and in his mind the cabin was totally changing.  It still had my original floor plan and foundation, but that was about it.  In his mind it moved from a simple structure to a miniature custom home.  

My dad's heart was in the right place.  He wanted us to make something beautiful and that would be used for years, but this became an issue because  he didn't tell me about his ideas until later.  I was blindly going along and didn't stop to question or challenge his ideas.  No longer could we talk concretely about timelines or finances.  It started to become his project and I was just standing by.   When I would ask about concrete things like timeline or costs it became very vague.   
Working with family is really tricking and it's so easy to fall back into the role of child/parent.  My dad and I had never communicated on a professional level.  He would guide and I would follow.  I wasn't willing to own my ideas and push back.   If we we're going to finish this project things had to change.  Communication was a necessity!   I learned how to ask the right questions, insist on answers, and communicate my ideas.   He started to think of me as an adult. 

Time: 
You can accomplish a ton with three weeks of solid work, but we didn't realistically have that.   I had school and work and he had a company to run, so for four years we could only sneak away for small chunks of time.  Working like this has so many challenges.  We were constantly having to figure out where we left off and what supplies we needed.  The closest hardware store was over thirty minutes aways, so if we forgot an essential tool we were screwed!  We started making lists of the tools we would need for the next workday.  

July 2014, my husband and I moved to DC for work.  The cabin wasn't dried in, so whenever it rained it was breading mildew and welcoming decay.    I figured the it would never be completed.  In November, I decided to make a career change. and before jumping into a new job I wanted to finish the cabin!!! My mom had recently retired and was willing to work with me and my dad was going to come out as much as possible.  I thought I could finish it   in two trips.

1st trip: ten days and finishing the *exterior*.  We finished the roof; caulked, puttied and painted the exterior; installed three windows and finished installing the porch.  It rained for three days, so we weren't able to get the entire exterior finished.  

My mom, dad, and brother amazingly spent the weekends in between working on the cabin.  They installed the rest of the windows and worked on the chimney.  

2nd trip: eight days and finishing the *interior*.  We insulated;  prepped, painted, and installed the panelling (walls and ceiling); put in the heart pine beams; installed two of the four french doors; and put up a temporary loft.  We thought is was going to be finished.  Things always take longer than planned!

I decided to push back applying for jobs and come back a few weeks later for a final trip to finish this phase of the cabin. 

3rd trip: ten days and final touches.  We prepped and painted the interior, and furnished the cabin.  

##future
My husband likes to ask "Is the cabin done?" and I always say yes and no.  The interior of the cabin is finished, but there is so much more I want to do.  The outdoor kitchen, outhouse, and shower house aren't yet built.  We still rely upon a generator and propane for energy, and gallons water for drinking and hygiene.   If money was not an issue I would love to knock all of these things out.  We plan to save up over the next few years and work on these things we can.

Wolf Cabin was designed and built by me and my dad.  My mom, husand, and brother Sam have also been huge support through the entire project. Sam is a carpenter and is obsessed with the details! He would always ask to hold up the level one more time!  My mom is an eager worker; we call her The Ox.  She embraced any project we through her way whether it was priming hundreds of boards or holding a ladder.  My husband Morgan was the biggest supporter through the entire; he patiently listened to so many different rants and came out to work whenever he had a chance.  Several other amazing friends and family pitched in too!  The cabin wouldn't be here without these people!

I live in Washington, D.C. with my hubby and two big dogs (Homer and Plato).  I decided to build the cabin when I was a senior in high school, and recruited my dad for his help.  It took me a few years to save up cash and get her ideas straight, but we broke ground in 2010.  Since the project started, we are constantly learning what to do and what not to do.  I am currently splitting my time between DC and SC to finalize the construction on the cabin.  Camping, crafting, and veggie cooking are what I do in my free time.

My dad, Joel, is a contractor who builds beautiful custom homes in the SC Lowcountry. When he's not on a job site, you'll probably find him covered in sand on the volleyball court or playing with his dogs.  He currently is building his retirement home near the cabin and plans to spend his later years living off-the-grid with my mom.
